### Workflow

1. Installation & Setup
* Users install the extension from the Chrome Web Store.

* Users can access settings to customize voice commands, language preferences, and other accessibility options.
2. Activating Voice Control
* The user activates voice control via a click on the extension icon or a voice command like "Hey, Google."
* The extension begins listening for commands through the microphone.
3. Processing Voice Commands
* Speech is transcribed into text using a speech recognition engine (e.g., the Google Web Speech API).
* The extension processes the transcription and matches it to predefined voice commands.
* Contextual analysis is performed to determine what part of the web page the command applies to (e.g., selecting a link, scrolling, etc.).
4. Executing Actions
* Based on the recognized command, the extension triggers the appropriate browser action:
    * Navigation commands (back, forward, reload) control the browser's history.
    * Scrolling commands (scroll up, scroll down) adjust the page's scroll position.
    * Interaction commands (click on a link, submit a form) simulate user actions on the page.
    * Accessibility adjustments can be made (e.g., enlarging text, changing contrast).
5. Providing Feedback
* After executing a command, the extension can provide audio or visual feedback to confirm the action (e.g., "The page has reloaded").
* If an action could not be performed, feedback is provided (e.g., ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt find that link‚Äù).
6. Ongoing Voice Interaction
* The extension remains active, continuously listening for new commands as long as the user hasn‚Äôt deactivated it.
* Users can interrupt the ongoing command processing by saying ‚ÄúStop listening‚Äù or clicking on the extension icon.
7. Settings & Customization
* Users can customize the voice commands and their corresponding actions via the settings menu.
* Commands can be added or removed, and the user can set preferences for voice speed, volume, and language.
8. Exit
* The user can deactivate voice control by saying ‚ÄúStop listening‚Äù or clicking on the extension icon again.
* The extension stops listening and provides a confirmation
